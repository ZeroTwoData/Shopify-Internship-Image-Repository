## What is an Image Repository?
A container where images are deposited and stored.

## What Is the Purpose of This Application?
The purpose of this application is to store images of "aesthetic-looking" computer setups (hence the name of this repository, "Aesthetico"). Users can store images inside the repo, as well as share with others by rightclicking on the image to save to their drive. 

## How Does It Work?
Currently there are two functions to this repo:

1. Upload Build. Users can upload images from their computer to this repository
2. Filter By Name. Users can filter images by their "Build Name" (**images in the repo are placed in alphabetical order)
